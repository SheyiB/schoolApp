# schoolApp
A software developed for schooling system, whereby students can register their courses, check their results, and CGPA. Lecturers can also use this platform to upload students results, edit and modify. CGPA is calculated automatically. Created using Python and MySQL. Main modules are ready, just final finishing, comments, error handling and program standardization remains. I have an issue with connecting Python with MySQL using github. The program works perfectly on my system tho. Suggestions are greatly appreciated.
