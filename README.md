# schoolApp
A software developed for schooling system, whereby students can register their courses, check their results, and CGPA. Lecturers can also use this platform to upload students results, edit and modify. CGPA is calculated automatically. Created using Python and MySQL. Main modules are ready, just final finishing, comments, error handling and program standardization remains. Also I intend on adding a GUI using PyQT. Some of the interfaces are ready, just the linking of the interface with the code remains
I have an issue with connecting Python with MySQL using github. The program works perfectly on my system tho. 
Originally one of my SIWES project.
Suggestions are greatly appreciated.
